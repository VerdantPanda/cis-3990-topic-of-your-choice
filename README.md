Technology: I am going to teach myself about React JS state management and component reusability.

Rationale: For my tic tac toe app the main goals of the tutorial are to learn about state management and component reusability in React JS. Component reusability allows you to write a single unction component once and reuse it an unlimited amount of times. State management allows you to associate data with an individual component.
